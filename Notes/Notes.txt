When a user loads the application, wait for the user to interact with the page in order 
to initialize an audioContext. Initialize a primary audioSourceBufferNode.

After context and node initialization, begin retriving audioBuffer blobs from socket io connection. 
Every half a second, decode the audioBuffer and replace audioSourceBufferNode with a new one 
whose buffer is the recently decoded blob. Play the blob from from 0. Do this for each blob.

the problem might be related to the fact the the APP component seems to repeatedly reconnect
to the server. This might be the source of the problem. It needs to connect once, and only once.
THis might be due to re-rendering creating problems, or the connection dropping after a time.
