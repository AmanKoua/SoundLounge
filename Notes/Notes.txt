When a user loads the application, wait for the user to interact with the page in order 
to initialize an audioContext. Initialize a primary audioSourceBufferNode.

After context and node initialization, begin retriving audioBuffer blobs from socket io connection. 
Every half a second, decode the audioBuffer and replace audioSourceBufferNode with a new one 
whose buffer is the recently decoded blob. Play the blob from from 0. Do this for each blob.

I just verified that it might not be a server issue. When playin the audio blobs as audio
elements directly retireved from the mediaRecorder listener, the same issue persists!

    - Before you join a room, you will re-query the backend to retrieve rooms in order
        to ensure that you are joining the room with the most up to date settings.

For buffering mechanism, push each newly received audio packet to an array which will
serve as a queue. Whenever an item needs to be removed, it will simply be spliced from
the array.

When the array has 5 or more stored audio packets, pop the 1st element from the array 
and attach it to the audio element. Splice the element from the array. After another 750 ms, 
repeat the process.

If there's still audio playback lag, use 2 HTMLAudio tags instead of 1 and alternate between
the 2.

Current operation:

    - When an audio payload is received, it's appended to the queue. If the queue size is 
        greater than the buffer length and audio is buffering, set isAudioBuffring to false.

    - audioPlaybackInterval plays each audio packet in the queue until the queue is empty.
        When the queue is empty, audio buffering will begin again.

New operation:

    - While 1 audio tag is playing, another will be prepared with the new audio packet.

    - playAudioPacket method
        An audio packet arrives. If it's the first one, do not play until the 2nd one arrives.
        Prepare the 1st audio tag.

        When the 2nd one arrives, preprare the 2nd audio tag and play the first one.

        The next call call, play the 2nd audio tag and prepare the 1st one.

        alternate between the 2 audio tags for the previous step.
