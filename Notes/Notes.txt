When a user loads the application, wait for the user to interact with the page in order 
to initialize an audioContext. Initialize a primary audioSourceBufferNode.

After context and node initialization, begin retriving audioBuffer blobs from socket io connection. 
Every half a second, decode the audioBuffer and replace audioSourceBufferNode with a new one 
whose buffer is the recently decoded blob. Play the blob from from 0. Do this for each blob.

I just verified that it might not be a server issue. When playin the audio blobs as audio
elements directly retireved from the mediaRecorder listener, the same issue persists!
